# Model_of_StockMarket
This is my first work on Github, the simplest model of stockmarket. Hope one day I can win the State First-Class Natural Science Award too.

This model contains only two stocks, one with larger variations(risks) and one with less risks.
Of course the average return rate is higher for stock with larger variations.

You have 10000 RMB at first and you can buy or sell stocks many times within one day.
The prices of each day is generated by previous price and normal distribution.

Keep on holding you will get a positive return rate.

I haven't consider the condition that the prices go below zero because it's almost impossible to happen.

I will appreciate your advices and patchings for this code, but please do not laugh at me. Although my coding ability is very week, I still keep on practicing. Your advies are keen to my progress.

Many thanks!
